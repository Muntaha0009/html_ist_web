            Verdens Ende ("World's End", or "The End of the Earth" in Norwegian) is located at the southernmost 
            tip of the island of Tjøme in Færder municipality, Norway.
            It is composed of various islets and rocks and is one of the most popular scenic spots in the area,
             with panoramic views of the Skagerrak and fishing facilities. 
            It also has a replica of an old Vippefyr, an early type of beacon or lighthouse, erected in 1934.
