    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hobby</h1>
    <p>
        One of my greatest passions is <b>Travel</b>, as I love exploring new cultures, cuisines, and landscapes. There's something exhilarating 
        about embarking on new adventures and creating unforgettable memories in different corners. When I'm not jetting off 
        to new destinations, I find joy in indulging in two seemingly contrasting hobbies: <b>watching comedy and horror movies</b>. I believe
         laughter is the best medicine, and a good comedy film never fails to brighten my day and lift my spirits. On the other hand,
          the adrenaline rush and suspense in horror movies captivate me, making for thrilling movie nights. These hobbies add excitement 
          and diversity to my life,allowing me to unwind and appreciate the wonders of storytelling in both light-hearted and spine-chilling ways</p>
